# Use Case 3

<hr>

**Use Case**: Clearing Canvas with Space Bar

**Primary Actor**: User

**Goal in Context**: To clear the canvas of the program.

**Preconditions**: The program must be running and in a responsive state.

**Trigger**: Pressing the space bar.

**Scenario 1**: A user will press the space bar when they want a blank canvas.

**Exceptions**: The program may become potentially unresponsive. During this, the program can be terminated from the operating system.

**Priority**: High-priority.

**When available**: First release

**Channel to actor**: The primary actor communicates through the keyboard, one of the I/O devices, of the user. All commands are from the user.

**Secondary Actor**: N/A

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: N/A

**Open Issues**: We may need to implement a "are you sure?" function to double check if the user accidentally hit space bar or was it intentional.

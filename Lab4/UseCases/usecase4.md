# Use Case 4

<hr>

**Use Case**: User Draw

**Primary Actor**: User

**Goal in Context**: To draw on the canvas where the mouse points.

**Preconditions**: The program must be running and in a responsive state.

**Trigger**: (1) Clicking the left key of the mouse once and then clicking left key again once. (2) Continuously holding down the left key of the mouse.

**Scenario 1**: A user will press the left key, move the mouse on canvas to draw, and then click the left key of the mouse again.

**Scenario 2**: A user will press down and drag their mouse across the canvas to draw.

**Exceptions**: The program may become potentially unresponsive. During this, the program can be terminated from the operating system.

**Priority**: High-priority.

**When available**: First release

**Channel to actor**: The primary actor communicates through the mouse, one of the I/O devices, of the user's system. 

**Secondary Actor**: N/A

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: N/A

**Open Issues**: We may implement other creative ways for user to draw such as holding down space while dragging mouse across.

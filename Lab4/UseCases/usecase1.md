# Use Case 1

<hr>

**Use Case**: Program Window Size

**Primary Actor**: User

**Goal in Context**: To create a window with 600x400 drawable canvas size.

**Preconditions**: The program must be started by user.

**Trigger**: Opens program/application.
  
**Scenario 1**: A user will double click a shortcut of the application.

**Scenario 2**: A user will run the program with command line commands. 

**Exceptions**: The computer or program may be potentially unresponsive. In this case, the program can be terminated from the operating system.

**Priority**: High-priority.

**When available**: First release

**Channel to actor**: All communication goes through I/O devices including the keyboard and the mouse. The user can decide what input to give to the I/O device in order to interact with the system which is responsible for maintaining focus of the window when the user clicks, and running the program

**Secondary Actor**: N/A

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: N/A

**Open Issues**: We may need to implement multiple canvas sizes for user to pick instead of locking it at 600x400 when launched.
